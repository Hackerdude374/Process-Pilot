# CPU Scheduling Algorithms Comparison Simulator

## Overview
This repository contains a CPU scheduling simulation project implemented in C++. The project aims to compare the performance of two CPU scheduling algorithms: Shortest Job First (SJF) and Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN). The simulator executes a set of processes with CPU requirements and collects various statistics to evaluate the efficiency of each algorithm.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
3. Prepare input files with process details (refer to input format).
4. Run the simulator executable with the appropriate input file.
5. View the output files for simulation results.
